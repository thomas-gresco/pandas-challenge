## Summary of the Analysis
I began by summarizing the data given by district and then by school type. This allowed me to determine that the top 5 school districts in terms of percentage of overall passing are all Charter Schools. The lowest 5 school districts in terms of percentage of overall passing are all district schools. 
Next, I was able to categorize both the math and reading scores by grade for each school included in the data. Grades tended to be higher in both 11th and 12th grade for reading and math.
Furthermore, I organized the data in terms of school spending and the budget each school had per student. This was organized in a table that compared the schools spending to their average math and reading scores. The same was done for the size of the school and the type of school.

## Conclusions
One conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that the overall passing score which includes the percentage passing math and the percentage passing reading is higher when the school has less money to spend on each student individually. Another conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that schools with over 2000 students have much lower percentages of students that are passing both math and reading than schools with less than 2000 students. Furthermore, Charter schools had a much higher percentage of overall passing than district schools.
